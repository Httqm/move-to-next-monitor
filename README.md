# move-to-next-monitor

Script to move windows from one monitor to the next in XFCE.

I am NOT the original other of this script :
 * I forked it from : https://github.com/jc00ke/move-to-next-monitor
 * and made plenty of _personal_ cosmetic changes / deletions

I mapped `F12` to exectute this script (XFCE Start Menu | Settings | Keyboard | Application Shortcuts).

## Dependencies

```
sudo apt install xdotool wmctrl
```
